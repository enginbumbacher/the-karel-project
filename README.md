# Installation and Development server

```sh
# Make sure pnpm is installed (pnpm is a better package manage than npm)
sudo npm install -g pnpm

# useful commands (must be executed from within this folder)
# install basic requirements
pnpm install

# start the dev server
npm run dev

# go to the localhost link in the printed message
# it will be https, so you will need to accept the "insecure" development certificate
# in your browser in order to see the app
```
